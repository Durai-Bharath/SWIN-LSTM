# MRI-Brain Tumor Detection using SWIN-LSTM Model

## ðŸ“– Description
The **MRI-Brain Tumor Detection using SWIN-LSTM model** project aims to accurately detect brain tumors using a hybrid model that combines the strengths of **SWIN Transformer** and **LSTM**. This system effectively classifies binary and multiclass labels, offering a reliable tool for medical imaging analysis. It also features a simple and intuitive user interface for uploading MRI scans and displaying the classification results.

The model was trained effectively using an **integrated GPU** for improved performance and compared against a **CNN-LSTM** model to evaluate and validate its output.
